                            Bowen Therapy is a gentle, holistic treatment that works on the soft connective tissue of
                            the body. This technique uses subtle inputs, known as "moves," which stimulate the body to
                            initiate its self-healing process. Unlike other forms of manipulation, Bowen Therapy is
                            non-invasive and allows the body to reset and heal naturally.

                                How Bowen Works
                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                Bowen Therapy involves small, precise movements over muscles, tendons, and ligaments.
                                These moves are designed to communicate with the nervous system, encouraging the body to
                                relax, reset muscle tension, improve range of motion, and enhance lymphatic drainage and
                                detoxification. The technique is performed in sequences with breaks in between, allowing
                                the body to respond and integrate the treatment effectively

                                    The intriguing healing modality of Bowen Therapy was introduced to me on weekend
                                    away with friends which became a pivotal turning point in my life. One friend was
                                    enduring a painful flare up from a reoccurring and debilitating back problem. As
                                    stories often happen, series of fortuitous events led to a Bowen Therapist joining
                                    us, who kindly offered our friend a treatment - her healing response was beyond
                                    amazing, enabling her to join all the planned activities completely pain free.

                            What can I say, Heather fixed my knee! I damaged my arcuate ligament 10yrs ago and had it
                            operated on.
                            Since then I had a limp and pain ranging from mild to chronic. From the very first treatment
                            I had relief,
                            so decided to commit to more visits. Several sessions later.. pain free! I now continue to
                            see Heather to
                            stay well. Heather is caring and a professional Bowen Therapist, I would recommend her in a
                            heartbeat to
                            anyone in pain or looking for a holistic way to maintain their health.

                            Bowen Therapy was recommended to me for my Chronic Sinusitis. I was sceptical but hopeful.
                            WOW, my healing
                            was truly amazing and I am eternally grateful for Heather’s work. I endured Chronic
                            Sinusitis for 7yrs,
                            nothing helped. Breathing was difficult and after 5pm every day was really distressing.
                            Within days of my
                            first session there was a huge improvement in my breathing, I was feeling 75% better. Each
                            session
                            continued to improve my health. I actually don’t even suffer from Sinusitis anymore but I go
                            to Bowen once
                            a month now to stay well.

                            I am so grateful to find Bowen Therapy with Heather. I decided to try it for my Multiple
                            Sclerosis because
                            I read an article saying that Bowen Therapy can help relieve MS symptoms. Also my sister
                            see’s Heather for
                            her back. Turns out, Bowen Therapy does help, a lot! My Bowen sessions with Heather
                            definitely contributes
                            to feeling pain relief, leg strength, energy, improved sleep and other forms of relief. I
                            feel very relaxed
                            and safe during my treatments with Heather. I highly recommend her.

                            I have been seeing Heather on and off for a few years. Bowen has really helped my neck
                            tension and pain I
                            get from stress and work. I have found Bowen Therapy has also helped with my overall
                            physical and mental
                            well-being. Heather’s treatments are so good that I only go 2 to 3 times then I don’t need
                            to go back for
                            months.

                            Bowen Therapy was recommended to me for my Chronic Sinusitis. I was sceptical but hopeful.
                            WOW, my healing
                            was truly amazing and I am eternally grateful for Heather’s work. I endured Chronic
                            Sinusitis for 7yrs,
                            nothing helped. Breathing was difficult and after 5pm every day was really distressing.
                            Within days of my
                            first session there was a huge improvement in my breathing, I was feeling 75% better. Each
                            session
                            continued to improve my health. I actually don’t even suffer from Sinusitis anymore but I go
                            to Bowen once
                            a month now to stay well.
